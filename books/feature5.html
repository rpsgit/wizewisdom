  <h1>Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>by Carl Jung</strong></p>

  <h2>Core Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Jung introduces <em>synchronicity</em> as meaningful coincidences that aren’t linked by direct
    cause-and-effect but feel deeply connected to your inner world. These events suggest that life
    is not purely random—it’s also shaped by <strong>patterns of meaning</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meaning over chance:</strong> What matters isn’t probability but the personal significance of the event.</li>
    <li><strong>Inner–outer reflection:</strong> External events can mirror inner states, needs, or emotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Archetypes at work:</strong> Universal symbols from the unconscious may surface through synchronicities.</li>
    <li><strong>Beyond linear causality:</strong> Not everything follows a simple cause–effect chain; meaning can be the connector.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Keep a journal of coincidences and note your thoughts/feelings at the time.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Use repeated meaningful patterns as signals to re-examine your options.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-reflection:</strong> When a synchronicity occurs, pause and ask, <em>What’s happening inside me?</em></li>
    <li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Presence helps you notice subtle connections in daily life.</li>
    <li><strong>Symbol literacy:</strong> Learn recurring numbers, dreams, or themes that may act as guidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Everyday Example</h2>
  <p>
    You think about an old friend and they call you unexpectedly. Rather than dismissing it,
    consider whether the relationship—or what it represents—needs attention right now.
  </p>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <strong>Overall Takeaway</strong>: Synchronicity reframes coincidences as <em>life’s meaningful signals</em>.
    By noticing and reflecting on them, you can align choices with your inner truth and navigate with more confidence.
