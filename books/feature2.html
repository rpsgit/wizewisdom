    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>The book isn’t really about motorcycles—it’s about <strong>how we approach life, work, and meaning</strong>. 
    Pirsig uses the metaphor of motorcycle maintenance to explore <strong>quality of living</strong>.</p>

    <h2>3 Key Takeaways You Can Use</h2>

    <h3>1. Balance "Classical" and "Romantic" Thinking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Classical:</strong> logical, step-by-step, focused on systems (e.g., fixing a bike by following the manual).</li>
      <li><strong>Romantic:</strong> intuitive, emotional, focused on experience (e.g., enjoying the ride).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <em>Lesson:</em> Don’t live only in logic or only in feeling—integrate both for better decisions and richer experiences.</p>

    <h3>2. Quality as a Guiding Principle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"Quality" isn’t fully definable, but we recognize it in good work, good art, good living.</li>
      <li>Striving for quality in everyday actions (whether repairing a bike, writing code, or raising kids) creates meaning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <em>Lesson:</em> Ask yourself, “Am I doing this with quality?” instead of just “Am I getting it done?”</p>

    <h3>3. Life is Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Motorcycle maintenance is a metaphor: life requires ongoing care, attention, and patience.</li>
      <li>Rushing, ignoring details, or being careless leads to breakdown—whether in machines, relationships, or your own mind.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <em>Lesson:</em> Slow down, notice problems early, and fix them with care.</p>

   <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Pirsig teaches that a good life is about integrating reason and intuition, 
      pursuing quality in everything, and treating life itself like a machine you lovingly maintain.</p>
